# Bank Management System

A command line bank manager system where you can 
* Create/Remove accounts
* See Transactions of accounts
* Edit accounts

## Info

This is a CMake project. That means that for your specific system, you must generate the build
system. After that, you will have access to the source code, and be able to generate the
executable. 

Note that I have not tested this on Linux on MacOS. If for whatever reason it does not work, please
create an issue.

## About

I believe that the best way to learn how to code is through a combination of understanding and
application. Therefore, I have dedicated some of my time to try to go at these projects.

This is project 1/50 from the the [website](https://www.codewithc.com/c-projects-with-source-code/)
I am not quite sure if I will be able to do all of them (if any).
